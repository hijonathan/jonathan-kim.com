title: Boston Startup Checklist
---
Before starting Appcues, I had already consumed most of the startup stuff found on sites like Hacker News. I knew about MVPs, fundraising, business models, etc. I knew I needed to do those things.

This is a checklist of the other stuff.


### 1. Talk to your co-founder(s).

Before starting any of the other steps, it's important to talk to your co-founders first and understand your needs/circumstance. You should have all the answers before meeting with services professionals, or be prepared to waste time and money.

Here are a handful of good things to know beforehand:

#### Legal

- Is there even a chance you'll raise money?
- How is ownership split?
- Where are your team members located?
- Is anyone not a U.S. citizen?

#### Banking

- How will customers pay you?
- How will you pay vendors (credit card, check, wire, etc.)?

#### Accounting

- What's your projected burn rate?
- Do you have physical assets/goods?
- Do you plan to do the bookkeeping yourself?
- How will you pay employees?
- Will you be offering benefits?

### 2. Get some lawyers.

At this point, there are two paths you can go down:

1. Incorporate using LegalZoom or Clerky.
2. Saddle up with a real firm.

For what it's worth, I'm not a legal expert and I didn't do nearly as much research as I should have when choosing a firm. However, I've had a great relationship with WilmerHale. They have a pretty strong presence in the Boston startup community and offer an attractive startup package. Foley Hoag is another startup-friendly firm, and each has different benefits.

### 3. Get a bank.

The two big startup banks are Square One and Silicon Valley Bank. SVB was recommended to me by a friend, and it's also what we used at Performable, so it was a no-brainer for me. Joe Kopnisky has been extremely helpful in connecting me with other smart people in the community, and his team is extremely active in Boston. By contrast, I haven't heard a single person in Boston mention Square One.

SVB also has a startup package.

### 4. Find a great accountant.

Don't wait until taxes are nearly due before finding an accountant. Find one early to help you get set up with a online accounting platform (Quickbooks, Xero, Wave, etc.) and payroll system (Quickbooks, ZenPayroll, etc.) if appropriate. Bookkeeping can be mostly automated, so just do it early to save time when tax season comes up.

I tried using TurboTax for Business, but I don't think it's designed for software startups. Either way, if you're not sure what you're doing with taxes/accounting, cut your losses and pay someone else to do it. You'll save time and minimize the risk of being penalized for errors.

### Need an intro?
