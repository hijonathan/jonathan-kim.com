<p>Here are a few of the people I've worked with that could really use a meal.</p>

<p><strong>Andy Alyward</strong>
Andy is an extremely proficient learner. He's a sponge and makes an effort to be in places where he can absorb the most knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Hartley Brody</strong>
Economics major turned marketer turned developer. Hartley is very driven and self-aware.</p>

<p><strong>Amanda Iglesias</strong>
At 25-years-old, Amanda has been promoted more times than most of us will be in our entire career. She seems to have no patience for stalling.</p>

<p><strong>Matt Pirkowski</strong>
Matt's dedication to improvement is inspiring. Just a year ago, he was consulting marketers on SEO. Today, he's consulting engineers on javascript best-practices.</p>
