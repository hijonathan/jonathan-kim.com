I recently rewatched an animated version of Dan Pink's talk on what motivates people. One of the interesting findings he shares is that <em>people perform better when they have autonomy</em>.

But the symptoms of autonomy&mdash;control and ownership&mdash;don't have to be real. Millions of Americans lease cars or take out long-term loans against a house, yet each one of them believes, without a shred of doubt, that the car or house is <em>theirs</em>. <strong>Ownership is a state of mind</strong>.

So how do we get that into the workplace? Pink's lecture gives us the problem, but he doesn't leave us with a prescriptive solution. How do we get that magical point of perspective into even the most junior employee at a company?

I don't actually have an answer, but I think there are a couple ways to root out ownership. Of those, this is my favorite:

<strong>If shit hits the fan, are you the first person they come to?</strong>

The first person who is looked at to solve a problem is the real owner of that area. I think it's important to let that responsibility fall on the shoulders of every employee at a company, so that each person has their area of ownership. That, by itself, probably isn't enough to motivate someone, but it's a start at identifying the hurdles of true ownership.
