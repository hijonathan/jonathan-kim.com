I've gotten this question for a while now, and I'm only now starting to come up with something that sounds half intelligent. In web design, I think there are three main disciplines:

<h3>Web Designer</h3>
Web designers create prototypes and graphics in desktop software programs like Adobe Fireworks. I think this is the biggest point of distinction for a web designer, who can be as proficient in print or industrial design as they are at web design.

<h4>Strengths</h4>
Web designers excel at the polish that makes a design charming. They're particularly skilled at creating great marketing websites that need personality and don't require a huge amount of thought of how it "feels" to use each page as a part or whole.

<h4>Weaknesses</h4>
Not a programmer, and not really too deep into the science (and there's a lot of science) behind user experience.
<h3>Front-End Engineer</h3>
A front-end engineer is a programmer who specializes in the "V" part of MVC (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">model-view-controller</a>) frameworks. Their strongest programming languages are HTML, CSS and Javascript.

<strong>What do I tell my mom?</strong>
"I make prototypes and graphics for websites."

<h4>Strengths</h4>
Great at designing applications where functionality and usability are key. If you give them formatted data and a pre-configured server, they'll come back to you with a working application.

<h4>Weaknesses</h4>
At the end of the day, they're still engineers, and you definitely don't want an engineer designing your marketing material.

<h4>What do I tell my mom?</h4>
"I build interfaces for web applications."

<h3>UX Researcher</h3>
UX researchers are really different from the two above. A UX researcher plays a really important role in design, even if one doesn't exist at your company. This person conducts scientific experiments to learn everything about the interaction between a site visitor and a website. A UX researcher typically creates just enough collateral—either as a prototype, code or a whitepaper—to communicate their findings.

<h4>Strengths</h4>
Really understands people. A good UX person, in my opinion, knows how people think and feel. A UX expert takes an application that "makes sense" and turns it into something that makes people really happy while using it.

<h4>Weaknesses</h4>
They usually don't ship code or graphics, which is often a dealbreaker for small companies.

<h4>What do I tell my mom?</h4>
"By studying how people use the web, I help designers create great applications."

Over the past two years, I've transitioned from a web designer to a front-end engineer (with still a lot to learn), but I think I finally know a lot more about what I do. I don't just "build websites"
