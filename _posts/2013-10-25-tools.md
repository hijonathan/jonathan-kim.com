I generally don't like tools. In fact, I think few people actually like tools. Instead, what people really want are services.

You see, tools don't give people value, tools give people the power to create value. It's one of those big-little differences. If given the choice between $100 and a machine that can print up to 100 one dollar bills, which would you choose?

That's why I inherintly dislike tools: **tools represent work.**

Those who know me also know that I work **a lot** and care a lot about the tools I use. A good tool is awesome, but most of us already have all the tools we need. A developer's tools are a laptop and text editor. A marketer's tools are [a CRM](http://www.hubspot.com) and Excel. The only way to get someone to switch tools is to change the circumstances for using them, or build a better alternative. In exchange for a great tool, users are willing to pay a lot of money and devote serious calories to it.

Complementing those tools are services, like the internet. People also pay for services, but they don't put any additional work into it. I love services because they give me value in exchange for (in theory) less value.

That's the "service" in SaaS, and I think it's an important thing to remember when building or marketing a product. I'm writing this because of something Sam Boonin, VP of Product at Zendesk, said. He highlighted a trend of **tool overload** that seems to be plaguing software companies. Everyone is using 3 analytics products, 2 CRMs, etc., and here I was building yet *another* tool for someone like him to worry about.

I may eat these words later, but I'm not building a tool (and I think I convinced him of that). We all have enough tools, and I'm not trying to improve an existing one. I want to shape Appcues into a service that helps you passively, returning value in exchange for less value.
