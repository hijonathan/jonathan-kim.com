![A picture representing Motivation](http://placekitten.com/g/600/400)

Motivation is a tricky thing. For most of my life, I thought of it like blue eyes or long legs&mdash;you either had it, or you didn't. Turns out, it's more like vocal chords&mdash;everyone has it, but most people don't know how to use it properly.

Bad analogies can't hide the fact that everyone has a motivation. [Rob Go](http://robgo.org/2013/11/26/what-motivates-you/) and [Hunter Walk](http://hunterwalk.com/2013/10/10/love-greed-fear-whats-at-the-core-of-your-product/) have both written about motivation in the abstract. While love should be the strongest force, greed and fear can also be powerful motivations if you know how to use them.

Put simply, **find your motivation and put yourself opposite it.**

If you're motivated by greed, give yourself a lot to gain. If you're motivated by fear, give yourself something to be afraid of.

Abstracting a motivation helps broaden how it can be used, but it also weakens the effect. For instance, I'm motivated by adversaries. That could be abstracted as "greed" or "fear," but it doesn't have to be. Simply having a worthy adversary is motivating enough.

Pick a motivation and use it.
