I think every engineer should be prepared to answer the question: <strong>how does it look in IE7?</strong>

No one <em>enjoys</em> supporting ancient, quirky browsers, but that's the reality we program in. Even if you work at the lucky minority of companies that don't have to support non-modern browsers, you should at least know what does and doesn't work in other browsers.

From my experience, answering the cross-browser question is a lot easier when you do it from the very beginning. Most of the time, you can build a browser-proof website/application in your first attempt without doing a whole lot of additional browser checking. The trick is to <strong>constantly be aware</strong> of the things that do and don't work across browsers. Here are some tips I like to keep in the back of my mind:

<h2>For Browser-Proof HTML/CSS</h2>
<h3>1. Get a Good Reset Stylesheet</h3>
Enough can't be said about getting a <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/" title="Reset Stylesheet">solid reset stylesheet</a>. When you're programming across different browsers, a reset stylesheet really helps to level the playing field. The rest of the tips for this section assume that you're using a reset stylesheet, since it usually alleviates a majority of the pain that comes from coding cross-browser compatible HTML/CSS.

<h3>2. Understand Floats and Clear/Clearfix</h3>
I spent my formative years of web design believing that clear/clearfix was some magical technique that I could apply when I was in a bind. As a result, my code was litered with empty clearfix divs (<code><div class="clearfix"></div></code>) at the end of a random series of floated block-level elements. Here's what made it a lot clearer for me:

Clearfix should be applied to the block-level element that wraps a cluster of floated divs. If you think about floats as free-roaming hippies, a div with clearfix is the 1980s, roping these crazy floaters into productive yuppies.

So this is the proper usage:

<pre>
<div class="clearfix">
    <div class="float-left">floated left</div>
    <div class="float-left">floated left</div>
</div>
</pre>

Floated elements ignore the rules of the context around them. If the above example didn't have clearfix, the wrapping div would have a height of 0px because the two child elements ignore the rules of their parent. For a more complete breakdown of how clears work, I recommend checking out the <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/clearing.html">clearing article on quirksmode.org</a>.

<h3>3. Use Code Compilers</h3>
I'm a huge fan of using <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> and <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>, and one of my favorite parts of using it is that it helps write cross-browser compatible CSS for you.

For example, in 


<h2>Browser-Proof JavaScript</h2>
<h3>1. Watch out for trailing commas</h3>
This is a pretty common one, but it's worth reiterating. IE7 throws a massive error when you have trailing commas in arrays. For instance, this will break in IE7:
<pre>var array = [
    one,
    two,
    three,
]</pre>

The errors won't always be clear, but that that last comma is what's destroying your code. Always run jsLint where you can, and jUnit if you're privy to javascript unit testing.
