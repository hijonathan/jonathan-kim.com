Tonight I overheard some HubSpot engineers strategizing how to cultivate our team brand through better marketing. They were talking about how great the company's vision is, and they just want to spread the word. Believe it or not, they want to use HubSpot and inbound marketing to do it.

It may seem unremarkable, but to me, that's a milestone. It's because engineers are judgmental—they won't associate with something they think is crap and will be the first to tell you so. But the conversation I heard tonight tells me that our team is proud of what HubSpot is doing, both in the product and in the world, and they want to evangelize it.

Engineers marketing HubSpot. I'm almost certain you would not have seen that happening among <em>these</em> engineers a year or two ago.
