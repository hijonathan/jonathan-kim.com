<h3>1. 5,000 CSS Rules Per File</h3>
Turns out you can't have more than 5,000 style rules in a single CSS file. Hopefully you never run into this, but it can definitely happen when you're bundling library CSS together.

<h3>2. 31 Style Tag Limit</h3>
Source: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262161" title="Microsoft Reports IE Style Tag Issue">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262161</a>

This one is a lot rarer, but it's definitely something you'll run into if you're working on a more mature codebase. IE7/8 will not allow you to have more than 31 <code>style</code> or <code>link</code> tags on the page. While that's not recommended in production environments, it's not entirely unheard of in dev or QA environments where having everything unbundled is helpful for debugging.

3. Maximum URL Length

Certain versions of IE don't allow urls longer than 255 characters. After that, stuff just gets chopped off, resulting in bad paths.
