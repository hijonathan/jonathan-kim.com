<p>I've finally declared "bankruptcy" and decided it was really time to blog, and blog seriously. Being an aspiring entrepreneur at <a href="http://www.hubspot.com" title="Hubspot">an innovative software company</a> means getting awesome blog content hand-delivered to you <strong>every day</strong>. So far, I've made the stupid mistake of not capitalizing on that opportunity to share what I'm learning.</p>

<p>Please bear with me as I develop this blog into something amazing (and attractive to look at). I'm great at shipping products at work, but I've always been my own most critical customer (although <a href="http://connienomnoms.tumblr.com/" title="Connie Lu">my girlfriend</a> is a close second :P). Tearing down my old portfolio site and putting up this ugly, default theme is a huge step for me.</p>

<p><strong>That's the last time you'll hear me talk about myself.</strong> Now, on to writing compelling content :].</p>
