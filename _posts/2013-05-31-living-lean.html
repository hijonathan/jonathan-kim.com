<img style='float:right;margin: 0 0 15px 15px' class=" wp-image-522" title="lean" src="http://jonathan-kim.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/lean.jpg" alt="" width="315" height="365" />I got some sage advice from <a href="http://twitter.com/csavage" target="_blank">Chris Savage</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/brendan" target="_blank">Brendan Schwartz</a> of <a href="http://www.wistia.com" target="_blank">Wistia</a> fame: live lean. The pair lived in a 10-person house spending $600/mo on rent <em>combined</em> and an average of $15/wk on food each. When "eating in" means staying in business one more day, <strong>every dollar really does count</strong>. The duo said that living lean is easy once you're in the habit of it. "Start now," they said.

The benefit? <strong>Endurance.</strong>

Chris and Brendan attribute their ability to endure the long and rocky ride of entrepreneurship to their ability to live and operate on very little. So that's what I'm gonna do. Starting in June, I'm living lean(-er), cutting every spending category (except rent, since I'm stuck with a lease) <strong>in half</strong>, and continually reducing it each following month.

I'd love to hear suggestions on how to make this even more successful.
