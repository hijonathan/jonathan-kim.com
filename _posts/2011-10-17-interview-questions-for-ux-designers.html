The talent grab for developers is quickly extending to user experience designers. Although design has been around for a long time, the role of a dedicated experience designer is still pretty new.

Here are a few questions that I think could be useful when interviewing designers.

<h3>1. How would you optimize the user experience of an elevator?</h3>

Like cross-walk signals, using an elevator is still a common, but not perfect, experience. It's no trip to the Department of Motor Vehicles, but it could certainly be more pleasant. Some ideas on how to make that experience better:
<ul>
	<li>Make the elevator go express when all passengers are headed to the lobby and the elevator is at maximum capacity.</li>
	<li>Give an indication of the elevator's location, so people waiting can track it's progress.</li>
	<li>Change the elevators' "holding" location to respond to traffic patterns. E.g. at the top and middle floors during check-out, and at the lobby during check-in.</li>
</ul>

<strong>What does this reveal?</strong>
UX design is about more than swatches and pixels: it's about solving a problem. A good designer should be able to identify problems and come up with practical solutions, regardless if it's digital or not.

<h3>2. What is "visual hierarchy"?</h3>

Visual hierarchy describes the importance and order of elements in a layout. It's influenced by position, size, color, contrast, spacing, and pretty much every element of design.

<strong>What does this reveal?</strong>
A good understanding of visual hierarchy indicates an awareness (not necessarily a command) of intentional designing. Everything on the page should have purpose. Jason, from 37signals, has <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3024-questions-i-ask-when-reviewing-a-design">an awesome blog post</a> with some simple questions that really sweat the details.

<h3>3. What everyday object is an example of great design, and why?</h3>

This is one of my favorite questions to ask, mostly because I spend a lot of time thinking about it myself. My least favorite answer for this question is "______ from Apple." Some cool answers:
<ul>
	<li>Public bathroom layouts</li>
	<li>Alarm clocks</li>
	<li>Wallets</li>
	<li>Cooking ware</li>
</ul>

<strong>What does this reveal?</strong>
Someone who can charismatically answer this question is able to communicate design and is comfortable talking about it. As a necessity of working with others, a designer should be able to explain and defend their decisions. A convincing answer also shows that the candidate is able to reverse-engineer a design, which means they're able to learn from others and identify trends.
