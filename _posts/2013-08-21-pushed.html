These days, it's hard to find someone who can actually push you. It just not in our culture to demand others to do better or to be better.

I don't buy the "I'm satisfied with who I am" argument. Even the greatest civil rights leaders—people like Ghandi, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rosa Parks—weren't satisfied with who we were, which is why they set out to change us. What if they had respected our decision to "just be ourselves?"

The workplace is (hopefully) an environment built on respect, but it can deter peers from challenging each other or maintaining a high bar of quality.

Figure out what your hot buttons are, and understand which direction they propel you in. Personally, overwhelming me propels me negatively, but duty and pride propel me forward.
