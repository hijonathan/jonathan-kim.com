Sometimes, the smallest feat is the toughest. Here are some idioms to help you conquer those nagging pixels.

<h3>Simpler columns</h3>

Say you want to have a container with two equally-sized columns in it:

<pre>
&lt;div id=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;Column 1&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;Column 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

The standard way to do this is to apply a float to each column and give them a width of 50%. However, what if your columns have borders? What if you want to pad them? You'll end up with something like this:

<pre>
.column
    border: 1px solid #ccc
    float: left
    padding: 10px 2%
    width: 45%
</pre>

But you end up with an imperfect box model. In addition, if you try to get the height of the <code>#wrapper</code>, you'll notice that the height is now 0. Let's fix both of these:

<pre>
#wrapper
    overflow: hidden

.column
    border: 1px solid #ccc
    box-sizing: "border-box"
    float: left
    padding: 10px
    width: 50%
</pre>

The <code>overflow: hidden</code> bit will fix our box height. This is the typical "clearfix" that you may have seen. Some people like to put a <code>div</code> with <code>clear: both</code> attributes, but that's adding unnecessary markup for most cases.

The second trick here is the <code>box-sizing: "border-box"</code> declaration. This let's us compute the width <strong>including</strong> the borders and padding (but not margins). Now 50% <em>really</em> means half.

<h3>Offset positioning</h3>

The idiom here is a pretty good one to remember: an absolute-positioned element inside a relative-positioned element can be positioned relative to the container.

Here's the example:

<pre>
&lt;div id=&quot;outside&quot; style=&quot;height: 300px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div id=&quot;inside&quot;&gt;Move me around!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

Right now, the "inside" element is positioned at the top of the "outside" element. To get it to stick to the bottom, you could simply do this:

<pre>
#outside
    position: relative

#inside
    bottom: 0
    position: absolute
</pre>

The values for <code>position</code> become a little confusing in this situation, but it works beautifully.

Another common case I run into is when using font-based icons like Pictos. To position the icon exactly where I want it, I can use relative/absolute positioning.

The HTML:
<pre>
&lt;p&gt;My text&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
A bit of SASS:
<pre>
p
    padding-left: 20px
    position: relative
    &:before
        content: &quot;i&quot;
        font-size: 18px
        left: -5px
        position: absolute
        top: -4px
</pre>
