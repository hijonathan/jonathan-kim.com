Whenever you're faced with the problem of owning a complicated product, the responsible solution should be to make that product simpler. Redesigning what you have into something that's intuitive and easy to use is <strong>scalable</strong>.

As a principle, the most responsible path is to solve this problem by revisiting the drawing board. If a customer can use your product without relying on a human being, it makes them self-sufficient and ultimately helps them do things quicker, which saves everyone money.

While that's an easy thing to say, it's a tough task to live up to. The best way to avoid this situation is to <strong>make design and user experience a core part of product development</strong> and hire an excellent designer early.
