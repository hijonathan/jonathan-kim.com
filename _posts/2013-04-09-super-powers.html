There are some people who I've met in my life who are damn good, who have given me the impression that I will probably never meet someone as good at X or Y as they are. And it's because he or she has a super power—something that puts him or her head and shoulders above the rest. It's led me to believe that <strong>super powers are soft</strong> <strong>skills </strong>that simply manifest themselves through tangible results.

Some people with really cool super powers:
<h3>Christopher O'Donnell: Focus</h3>
Even with a hundred great opportunities open to him, Christopher always finds a way to narrow in on the one that's most important.
<h3>Elias Torres: Energy</h3>
If you've ever met him, the first thing you'll realize is that he is absolutely tireless. He has more spunk and pep at 30-something than most people do at 15-years-old.
<h3>Ariel Diaz: Winning</h3>
According to his co-founder, <a href="http://restrictionisexpression.com/">Aaron</a>, whether he has tried something before or not, Ariel always finds a way to come out on top.
<h3>So what's my super power?</h3>
I've been seeking advice on super powers for a while now, and I've come up with a few guidelines to help me find my super power. While claiming that "winning is my super power" would sound cool, the benefit of having one is being able to harness it at will. I came up with 3 gut checks:
<ol>
	<li>Have I already been doing it in some other form?</li>
	<li>Does harnessing that power make me happier?</li>
	<li>Am I actually good at it?</li>
</ol>
I've (tentatively) discovered that my super power is <strong>growth</strong>. For a long time, I've been fascinated with this concept called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen">kaizen: continual improvement</a>. I may not be great at something right away, but I always get better, often significantly better, the next time around. It probably means I will never become an over-night success, and guys like Ariel will beat me quite often.

But given time, I too will win. And I will continue to win.
