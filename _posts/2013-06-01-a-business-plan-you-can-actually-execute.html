I had breakfast with Ric Calvillo this morning, and he offered a perspective I had never considered: that a business plan does not describe how the business should be run, but how <em>the founders</em> should run it. That is to say, the plan can (arguably, "should") be designed around the strengths and weaknesses of the founders. Let's see some examples.

Lone engineer:

Create a business plan that puts most of the value on the product since that is where the founder is strongest, and find a simple go-to-market strategy. Don't plan on hiring a large sales team—that will be cumbersome and difficult to do well. A good cofounder would be a great product marketer who can also sell.
