Over the past few months, I've been working almost exclusively on the frontend for <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/products/social-media">HubSpot's Social Inbox</a>. Early on, we knew we wanted to make notifications a central part of the system, and we wanted to take a mobile-first approach (while working within the limits of the greater HubSpot app).

So we made a responsive email that was heavily influenced by the techniques implemented by Twitter. These are the email notifications we came up with.

Also, my phone is in German.
<h3>Mobile:</h3>
There were two types of emails that you could receive: a list of tweet(s) or a forwarded tweet. They're pretty similar, but it was a good chance to test titles and subject lines.

<div style='text-align: center;'>
    <div style='background: url(http://jonathan-kim.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/iphone.png) no-repeat top center; padding: 147px 0 90px; height: 580px'>
        <div style='overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: scroll; width: 320px; height: 580px; padding: 0; margin: 0 auto;'>
            <img width='320' title="List of tweets" src="http://jonathan-kim.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-26-at-9.52.10-PM.png" alt="" />
        </div>

Tweets from a customer's HubSpot Contact were annotated with a color to signify their lifecycle stage. Orange for leads, green for customers and grey if the person sorta matched one of your contacts.

        <div style='overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: scroll; width: 320px; height: 580px; padding: 0; margin: 0 auto;'>
            <img width='320' title="Forwarded tweet, yay!" src="http://jonathan-kim.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-26-at-9.52.47-PM.png" alt="" />

I use Social Inbox to stay up-to-date on food startups in Boston.

<h3>Desktop:</h3>
The desktop version is very similar to the mobile one, but with more breathing room. We can (and should) add more web-only actions, to help people get a richer experience whenever possible.

<img title="Desktop version is actually lamer than mobile for once." src="http://jonathan-kim.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-26-at-9.54.17-PM.png" alt="" />

Would love to hear your thoughts.
