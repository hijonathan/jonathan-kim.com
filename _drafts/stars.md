An entrepreneur I respect once asked me who I looked up to the most. Instinctively, I said Hiten Shah, which I imagine is a pretty common answer among tech startup folk.

The entrepreneur didn't take well to that answer. He said Hiten was overrated. Sure, he has a few successful startups, but no IPOs, no billion dollar exits. That entrepreneur has a point, but here's why he's wrong. Hiten Shah is one of the greatest entrepreneurs of our generation.

Looking at achievements on their own is a flawed approach. Instead, let's evaluate entrepreneur's on their impact on society as a whole. Everyone points to Steve Jobs' quote about wanting to dent the universe, so let's judge people on their dents.

Elon Musk is a great entrepeneur, and in the metaphorical universe, he's a comet. Entrepreneurs like Musk are soloists with tons of inertia. He's a pioneer who inspires others through his own pursuits. Jobs was similiar. And when these types of people go after something, they leave a huge dent.

Hiten Shah, by contrast, is more like a sun. Powerful, but not through force. Rather, Hiten's impact on the universe is in the thousands of entrepreneurs he inspires, mentors and empowers. He does this in a seemingly endless number of avenues, including blog posts, conference talks, Twitter, interviews and even handing out his phone number to people he wants to help. Through him, thousands of people have the chance to have their own big impact, and that legacy will only grow over time.

A hundred years from now, who will have made a bigger dent?
