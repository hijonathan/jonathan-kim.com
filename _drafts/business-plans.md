I had breakfast with Ric Calvillo for the first time in early June. He offered a perspective I had never considered: that a business plan does not describe how the business should be run, but how *the founders* should run it. That is to say, the plan can (arguably, "should") be designed around the strengths and weaknesses of the founders. It sounds obvious, but it's not how we've been taught to create business plans.

The profiles of successful SaSS companies are not all the same. Some rely more on their product, like Dropbox, while others lean heavily on marketing, like Salesforce does. Still others use design (Mailchimp), cost (Amazon Web Services), etc. to set them apart in the market. These companies are strong in those areas because that's where their team specialized.

My primary strengths are in product development, and I have a good network of engineers, designers and product mentors I can leverage for help. My weaknesses are that I haven't had much management or hiring experience, I don't speak foreign languages, and I have very little exposure to sales.

Given that, hiring a sales team in China would probably be a recipe for disaster for me, even if the economics made sense for the business. Creating an amazing, self-service product would be more in my wheelhouse.

**Focus on your strengths, not your weaknesses.**

This advice has been given before, but when you hear that you can get 4 offshore developers for the price of one in the US, will you remember that? Maybe. It's tempting chase what has worked for others instead of what you're actually capable of.
